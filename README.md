# Web Scraping E-commerce Products

This project is a web scraper that extracts product details (name, price, reviews, and description) from an e-commerce demo site and saves the data to an Excel file. The script uses `requests` to retrieve the webpage, `BeautifulSoup` to parse the HTML content, and `pandas` to organize and export the data.

## Overview
This Python script scrapes the following details for tablets listed on the [Webscraper.io test site](https://webscraper.io/test-sites/e-commerce/allinone/computers/tablets):
- **Product Name**
- **Description**
- **Price**
- **Reviews**

The scraped data is saved to an Excel file for easy analysis and review.
